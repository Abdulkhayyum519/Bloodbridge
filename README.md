Problem Statement
In medical emergencies, every minute can determine survival, yet hospitals often face delays in securing compatible blood when their supplies are depleted. These delays are intensified by fragmented communication, manual outreach, and the absence of a centralized system that shows where matching blood is currently available. According to the American Red Cross, thousands of lives are lost each year in the United States due to the lack of timely access to blood. BloodBridge addresses this critical and preventable gap by providing a unified digital network that connects hospitals, blood banks, and donors in real time.
