Problem Statement
In medical emergencies, every minute can determine survival, yet hospitals often face delays in securing compatible blood when their supplies are depleted. These delays are intensified by fragmented communication, manual outreach, and the absence of a centralized system that shows where matching blood is currently available. According to the American Red Cross, thousands of lives are lost each year in the United States due to the lack of timely access to blood. BloodBridge addresses this critical and preventable gap by providing a unified digital network that connects hospitals, blood banks, and donors in real time.

The platform streamlines how hospitals request blood, how blood banks respond and fulfill requests, and how eligible donors are alerted when their blood type is needed. This ensures that the right blood reaches the right patient at the right time.

Medical research shows that earlier transfusions significantly increase survival rates, making timely coordination not just beneficial but essential. BloodBridge represents a necessary advancement in modern emergency care, reducing avoidable delays and helping prevent loss of life.

Target Users
Hospitals and Medical Staff:
Doctors, nurses, and administrators who need rapid access to compatible blood during emergencies and want a reliable way to manage, request, and track blood units efficiently.

Blood Banks and Donation Centers:
Organizations that collect, store, and supply blood, needing real-time updates on their inventory, seamless coordination with hospitals, and accurate tracking of all blood transfers and donations.

Donors:
Individuals willing to donate blood during emergencies or scheduled drives who wish to receive secure, timely alerts when their blood type is needed to save lives and have control over how and when they are contacted.

Application Goals
Faster Emergency Response:
BloodBridge aims to significantly reduce time-to-transfusion. The system enables hospitals to instantly locate and request compatible blood, minimizing delays between need and care. By connecting hospitals, blood banks, and donors on a unified platform, it ensures faster coordination and timely medical response.

Efficient Blood Management:
The platform provides real-time inventory visibility, allowing teams to track transfers and record every transaction with transparency. Each update is logged for traceability and accountability, preventing shortages and supporting data-driven decisions.

Connected Donation Network:
BloodBridge builds a reliable donor–institution network through secure, role-based dashboards. Donors can opt into emergencies, scheduled drives, or both, and are notified promptly when their blood type matches a need—enhancing engagement, trust, and community participation.


Key Features
Role-Based Dashboards:
Each user category—Hospital, Blood Bank, and Donor—has a dedicated dashboard aligned with its specific responsibilities and permissions.

Hospitals can manage inventory, create emergency and blood-drive requests, and track the status and history of each request using filters for blood type, urgency, and fulfillment source.

Blood Banks can monitor available stock, respond to hospital requests, and log fulfilled or pending transactions, with updates that automatically synchronize inventory in real time.

Donors can view only requests that match their blood type and consent preferences (emergency, drives, or both). The system automatically filters requests, ensuring that only eligible and matching donors can view or respond to a particular request.

This structure ensures clarity, security, and precision in targeting eligible users, improving overall coordination and response efficiency.

Real-Time Inventory Tracking:
Maintains continuously updated records of available blood units across hospitals and blood banks.

Utilizes TimescaleDB integrated with PostgreSQL to store every change as time-series data with precise timestamps.

Provides instant dashboard updates, historical tracking, and data-driven insights for better decision-making and planning.

Secure Role-Based Authentication:
Employs Argon2 password hashing to ensure strong encryption and data protection.

Enforces role-based access control, allowing users to view and act only on data permitted for their role.

Validates user identities through the core.auth table to maintain confidentiality, integrity, and HIPAA-aligned security standards.

Receipts and Transaction Logs:
Automatically records every operation, including hospital requests, blood-bank fulfillments, and donor responses, in the ops.transaction_logs table.

Logs timestamps, entity references, blood type, units, and status for complete traceability.

Uses validation triggers to ensure that all references are valid, maintaining data accuracy, audit readiness, and system reliability.
